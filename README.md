# Project Functions

* ## Auto Clicker:

     An auto clicker is a tool that automatically clicks inside the game, helping the player perform repetitive actions. This can be useful for resource gathering, constant attacks, and other tasks.
     This can be useful for resource gathering, constant attacks, and other tasks.

* ## Logging Function:

    The logging function sends log images to the Discord server. This allows players to track events in the game and alert players if your tribe is attacked.

* ## Auto Farm:

    The auto farm function allows you not to be near a teammate who will carry you; resources will be dropped automatically, and you can have tea, relax, or do your own thing in the meantime.

* ## Drop Mode:

    This function automatically collects items dropped from cave containers. You can leave this function enabled and go to sleep; when you wake up, your safe will be filled with valuable items and blueprints.

* ## Spam Mode:

    This can be useful if you have your own in-game store; you can enable this function and go to work. It will automatically log into the servers and send copied messages. You don't have to worry about the game crashing when logging into the server; if it happens, the game will restart.
